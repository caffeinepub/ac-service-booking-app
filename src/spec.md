# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a complete AC service booking application that allows customers to book AC services and view/manage all bookings.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data model for AC service bookings with fields for customer information, service type, scheduling, address, and status
- Implement backend CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for bookings
- Build a booking form interface with inputs for customer details, service type dropdown (installation, repair, maintenance, cleaning), date/time picker, and address
- Display all bookings in a list/table view with customer name, service type, scheduled date/time, address, and status
- Add controls to update booking status and cancel bookings
- Design a professional, clean visual theme with cohesive colors and clear typography suitable for a service booking application

**User-visible outcome:** Users can submit new AC service booking requests through a form, view all bookings in an organized list, and manage bookings by updating their status or canceling them.
